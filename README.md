# World Travel Log

The **World Travel Log** is a full-stack application designed to help users track and document trips across the globe. It allows users to log trips, destinations within each trip, expenses, activities, and personal notes.

## Purpose

This project was created as part of a **Database Design** course to explore practical implementation of data modeling, SQL, and full-stack development.   

The primary objective of this project was to apply database theory by defining entities, relationships, and constraints, and then implementing the schema in a real database environment. Beyond the backend, the project also included connecting the database to a frontend application. This demonstrated the full-stack workflow of sending and retrieving data through a user interface, and REST API endpoints.

## Domain-Specific Point of View

The **World Travel Log** application operates in the domain of travel journaling and itinerary management. This domain encompasses the need to record, remember, and make sense of complex travel experiences that often span multiple places, dates, and activities.

A successful World Travel Log application enables users to replicate the natural way people experience and remember their travels. Users should be able to document multi-destination trips, log important memories or insights, organize day-by-day activities, and associate costs with specific legs of a journey.

In this context, success is measured not only by the application's ability to store and retrieve data, but also by how well it supports storytelling, planning, and memory preservation. An effective travel log helps users revisit their journeys both emotionally and practically, perhaps by visualizing routes, exporting logs, or summarizing expenses. Features like location tagging, media attachments, and collaborative trip entries can further enhance the experience within this domain.
