# World Travel Log

The **World Travel Log** is a full-stack application designed to help users track and document trips across the globe. It allows users to log trips, destinations within each trip, expenses, activities, and personal notes.

## Purpose

This project was created as part of a **Database Design** course to explore practical implementation of data modeling, SQL, and full-stack development.   

The primary objective of this project was to apply database theory by defining entities, relationships, and constraints, and then implementing the schema in a real database environment. Beyond the backend, the project also included connecting the database to a frontend application. This demonstrated the full-stack workflow of sending and retrieving data through a user interface, and REST API endpoints.
